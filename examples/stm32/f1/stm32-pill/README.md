# Red and Blue gum-stick *pill* boards

The so-called *red* and *blue* boards have a gum-stick form factor with
an STM32F103C8T6 processor. They are usually sold as "minimum system
development" boards, and often also as "Arduino" boards, and have
either red or blue PCBs, giving rise to the name.

They appear to be of Chinese design, and are similar to the maple
mini.  However, they don't have a pre-installed maple boot loader, and
have a pair of jumpers instead of the "user" button. While the
STM32F103C8T6 is documented as only having 64K of flash as compared to
the 128K the STM32F103CBT6 used in the the maple mini has, but all
these boards seem to have 128K of flash.

Documentation is hard to find, but the LED on my blue pill board on
PC13. I have no idea if the red pill board is different, but it all
the other wiring appears to be identical.
