This small example program operates on internal FLASH memory by using libopencm3.

It's intended for all devboards with STM32f107 microcontrollers. To use this example it is essential to use USART1 port.
It writes text string entered via serial port terminal (ex. teraterm) into internal FLASH memory and then it reads it.
