This example program sends repeating sequence of characters
"0123456789" on USART2 on the ST Nucleo-F303RE eval board.

The sending is done in a blocking way.

Note that the Nucleo board exports the serial port as an ttyACM device
on Linux or a COM port on Windows. On Linux, if you can locate the
correct serial port as

/dev/serial/by-id/usb-STMicroelectronics_STM32_STLink_066CFF515056805087171825-if02

(note there will be differences based on the serial number of your
board) this may also show up as /dev/ttyACM0 if it was the first
serial port enumerated, if you have additional serial devices attached
to the USB port of your system they may show up as additional
ttyACM1/ttyACM2/... etc.

Connect to the port using `screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200` where you
replace the serial port with the one for your system.
