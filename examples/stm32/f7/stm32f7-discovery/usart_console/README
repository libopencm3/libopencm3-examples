Simple USART Example
--------------------

This example sets up a USART port and provides a few simple
character handling functions to that a short interactive program
can be demonstrated. It re-uses the clock setup from systick_blink
and that means you could do times delays but that aspect isn't used.

After this example we do character handling with interrupts.
