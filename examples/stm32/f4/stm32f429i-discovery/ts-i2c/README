README ts-i2c
-----------------

This example sets up a very basic LCD display on the DISCO
board and fills it with red.
Pressing on the touchscreen will turn the screen green.

It uses some graphics code that was inspired by AdaFruit graphics library.

The stmpe811 example driver uses i2c to communicate with the
touchscreen.
