This is a demo application for the 3-axis accelerometer LIS3DSH and the LEDs on the board using libopencm3.

It's intended for the ST STM32F4DISCOVERY eval board. Rotating the board on each side will turn ON the closest LED to the side parallel to ground. Position the board with LED on top turns ON all the LEDs while facing the board on the ground turns them OFF.
