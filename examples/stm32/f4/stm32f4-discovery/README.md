# README

This directory contains examples for the _original_ stm32f4 discovery.
The PCB should be labelled either MB997A or MB997B, and contains a user USB
port, and an audio dac on board, along with a MEMs microphone and an
accelerometer.

The later stm32f4 discovery boards, for the f401, MB1115B and for the f429i,
MB1075B will not work as is with these demos, but they should only need minor
tweaking for pin configurations.
