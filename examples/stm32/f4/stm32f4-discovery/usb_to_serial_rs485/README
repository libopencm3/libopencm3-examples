This example implements a USB CDC-ACM device, connected to USART2 (PA2/3)
DMA is used to transfer from USB rx side to the USART tx,
Interrupts are used from USART rx to fill the USB tx side.
Baud rates from 600-115200 are tested, as well as even/odd/no parity

A GPIO is toggled around USART transmissions to control an RS485 line
transceiver, following ST's app note. The RS485 driver enable line is,
by default, just the onboard red LEDs.

The orange/blue LEDs indicate tx/rx activity, but especially for the rx line,
you won't really see it without heavy data rates.

This example is heavily based on the existing usb_cdcacm and usart demos.
